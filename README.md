# US-air-quality-prediction
This project focuses on predicting ground-level O₃ (ozone) concentrations in various US cities using advanced machine learning models. We used the US Pollution dataset (2000–2023) from Kaggle and built robust models to analyze environmental patterns and forecast air quality levels.
